## Setup
### Requirements
* Linux (tested on Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04)
* Python 3.6+
* PyTorch 1.6 or higher (tested on PyTorch 1.13.1)
* CUDA 11.3 or higher (tested on CUDA 11.6+torch-geometric 2.2.0)

### Installation
  
``conda env create -f environment.yml``

## Training and Evaluation

The training and evaluation code can be overviewed in  ``main.py``. The code of proposed model can be seen in  ``/model``.

## Dataset

Due to ethical review and privacy concerns related to the patients from whom the dataset was collected, the authors have no rights to make the dataset publicly available. Currently, you can use your own multimodal dataset to run the code. The data types and requirements can be set according to ``/dataloader/Dataset.py``.
